<p>Hi Adam<br />
Greetings. I hope you are doing well.<br />
I am an entry level dev and interested in doing some personal node.js projects. I'd like to know if you have some ideas for necessary tools that will be useful in node development for other devs. Whatever I am looking for is an idea to code up a tool that will possibly enhance node.js developer productivity or potentially any other project using node.js. I want to basically get an idea why node.js is better than other web servers, in terms of its asynchronicity (if it recieves thousands of requests, how it handles it and how fast it is).<br />
Can you pl give me some ideas ?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
