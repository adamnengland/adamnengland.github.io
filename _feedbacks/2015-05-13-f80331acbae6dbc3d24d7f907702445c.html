<p>Hello, are you the one that realized:<br />
https://github.com/ghedipunk/PHP-Websockets/blob/master/license.txt<br />
?<br />
If you're not him ignore this message :)<br />
otherwise I've a question: I'm pretty new with websockets and I was trying to test something.<br />
I cannot understand how to use your send function in<br />
  protected function process ($user, $message)<br />
  {<br />
    $this-&gt;send($user,$message); //etc<br />
Ok when the client connect he receive the message, ("welcome") but what if I want to send that message to another client?<br />
For example, client 1 connect and he receive "welcome" msg, meanwhile client 2 receive "Client1 is online" msg.<br />
At the moment i'm using mysql to store vars ($user-&gt;id etc)</p>
<p>Thanks you!<br />
