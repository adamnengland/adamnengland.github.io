    Message\";s:2350:\"Hey there Adam,\r\n\r\nI thought this blogpost posted in the
    dev forum of SugarSync can address the past issue with authentication information.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n\r\nFolks,\r\n\r\nAs
    you may have seen if you've looked at your developer console or browsed the documentation
    on the developer site today, we are changing the way authentication and authorization
    work in the Platform API. I wanted to explain why we're making this change and
    how it affects you, as developers.\r\n\r\nFirst, let's talk about what's changing.
    The whole process is documented on our developer site here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sugarsync.com/dev/get-auth-token-example.html\r\n\r\nThe
    short version is that we've updated the authorization protocol so that apps no
    longer need to store users' passwords in order to acquire access tokens that can
    be used to access their accounts. Instead, apps use a password once to acquire
    a refresh token. This refresh token can then be used to get an access token, and
    it's persistent, so it can be saved and used again later.\r\n\r\nThe most important
    benefit of this change is that there is now no reason for an app to store a user's
    SugarSync password: you can simply store the refresh token, instead. A secondary
    benefit is that users can see which apps they have allowed to access their accounts,
    and they can revoke this access on an app-by-app basis via the SugarSync Account
    page.\r\n\r\nOf course, we obviously can't break the many apps users depend on
    already, so we are transitioning to this new model gradually. As of today, all
    new developers must use the new authorization model, but existing developers can
    continue to use the old approach. We will continue to support the old mechanism
    for at least six months from today, and after that point will make a decision
    regarding how to decommission it. After November 23, the old interface may stop
    working with little or no notice.\r\n\r\nWe believe the new authorization framework
    is much more secure and provides a better user experience than the old interface,
    so we strongly urge you to adopt it sooner rather than later. If you have any
    questions or concerns about this change, please send a message to the mailing
    list or, if you'd rather, email me directly.\r\n\r\nThanks for supporting SugarSync
    and stay tuned—there are more exciting changes coming down the pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nJim
