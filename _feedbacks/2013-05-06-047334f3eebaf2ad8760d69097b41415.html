    I know how annoying it can be to receive so many emails from recruiters; our Nerds
    get them daily. If things are going well for you at Tindall, please let me know
    and we won’t bother you again.\r\n\r\nWe’re looking to expand our Java and Front
    End Development team in Kansas City and would like to talk with you about joining.
    Our mission is to be the best place on earth for Nerds to work; we have already
    achieved awards to that end. Some of our perks include free breakfast, a very
    relaxed atmosphere and the ability to bring your dog to work (among other benefits)!\r\n\r\nLet’s
    set up a quick call. I can answer any questions you have about The Nerdery and
    you can tell me what makes you awesome besides your tech skills (even if you might
    not be interested in working here).\r\n\r\nWhat is it like working at The Nerdery?
    Check out this video: http://vimeo.com/thenerdery/postcard\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Leah
