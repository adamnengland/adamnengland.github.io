I'm pleased to announce that my newest video series, Rapid Lo-Dash is available for purchase through Packt Publishing.

You can get all the details and view the free sample here: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/rapid-lo-dash-video">Rapid Lo-Dash</a>

If you're a JavaScript developer, and you aren't using <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lo-Dash</a> yet, you really need to check it out. It'll help you write some cleaner, faster, more maintainable code. Don't believe me?  Take a look at this example, and decide which code you would rather maintain.

{% highlight javascript %}
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
var odd_numbers = [];
for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] % 2 == 1) {
    odd_numbers.push(numbers[i]);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
var odd_numbers = _.filter(numbers, function(num) {
	return num % 2 == 1;
});
{% endhighlight %}
Rapid Lo-Dash walks you through the basics of setting up your development environment, and using Lo-Dash to work with arrays. We'll see examples of how to use Lo-Dash to work with object, collections, chaining, and get into some basic functional programming concepts.

Thanks to the team at Packt Publishing for working with me to create this video series - hope you enjoy it.
