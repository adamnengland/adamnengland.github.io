  <p>Rapid Lo-Dash walks you through the basics of setting up your development environment, and using Lo-Dash to work with arrays. We'll see examples of how to use Lo-Dash to work with object, collections, chaining, and get into some basic functional programming concepts.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to announce that my newest video series, Rapid Lo-Dash is available for purchase through Packt Publishing.</p>
<p>You can get all the details and view the free sample here: <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/rapid-lo-dash-video">Rapid Lo-Dash</a></p>
<p>If you're a JavaScript developer, and you aren't using <a href="https://lodash.com/">Lo-Dash</a> yet, you really need to check it out. It'll help you write some cleaner, faster, more maintainable code. Don't believe me?  Take a look at this example, and decide which code you would rather maintain.</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];<br />
var odd_numbers = [];<br />
for (var i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {<br />
  if (numbers[i] % 2 == 1) {<br />
    odd_numbers.push(numbers[i]);<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>{% highlight javascript %}
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];<br />
var odd_numbers = _.filter(numbers, function(num) {<br />
	return num % 2 == 1;<br />
});<br />
{% endhighlight %}</p>
