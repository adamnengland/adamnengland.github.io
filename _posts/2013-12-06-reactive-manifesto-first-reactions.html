<p>While visiting the Play Framework website, I noticed a new banner in the top right corner. Perhaps "new" isn't correct - I've been almost exclusively in Node.js and Rails land for the past 6 months, so I might be behind the times on this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="/assets/screen-shot-2013-11-10-at-10-18-14-pm.png"><img  alt="Screen Shot 2013-11-10 at 10.18.14 PM" src="/assets/screen-shot-2013-11-10-at-10-18-14-pm.png" width="240" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>Following the links takes us to <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">The Reactive Manifesto</a>. As of December 6, 2013, the manifesto has 3098 signatures, and a quick google search shows that the term is taking off pretty quickly. So, I decided to dive in for a quick read, and see what, if any changes it might suggest for my development style.</p>
<blockquote><p>This architecture allows developers to build systems that are event-driven, scalable, resilient and responsive...<br /> <em> -The Reactive Manifesto</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>In General...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The manifesto seems to encourage some behaviors that I really like. &nbsp;For example, event-driven systems are a big part of reactive applications. &nbsp;As a concrete take-away, I certainly like the idea of using lightweight message queues as a way to decouple event publishers and subscribers. &nbsp;And while we are at it, let's stay away from clumsy, closed systems like JMS, and stick to open, Polyglot platforms like RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ.</li>
<li>Resiliency. &nbsp;This is the part of the manifesto that I should probably spend the most time absorbing. &nbsp;As much as I hate it, I've written Node.js apps in the past that would crash the whole server on uncaught errors. &nbsp;The classic problem of Cascading Failure shouldn't be nearly so prevalent. &nbsp;Treating errors as "events" rather than failures makes your app way more resilient.</li>
<li>Big servers are for suckers. &nbsp;I know a few Sys Admins still get their jollies from putting together big iron setups, but all the cool kids are scaling horizontally. &nbsp;Multi-threaded applications, and the complex, proprietary technology behind them, is less attractive than single event-driven, non-blocking processes. &nbsp; The Reactive Manifesto, at some level, is a guide for writing distributed systems that are resilient in their software design, but also targeted at the physical resiliency of cloud computing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With My Java Developer Hat...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you like developing in the Play! Framework, you'll already like a lot of what the manifesto has to say. &nbsp;No surprise, due to to fact that Typesafe seems to be the driver behind the manifesto. &nbsp;In any event, a few obvious features that Play! provides for Reactive Applications
<ul>
<li>Play! (unless you opt-out) runs on Netty.io, a asynchronous, event-driven application server, that supports Non-Blocking io. &nbsp;The Reactive Manifesto (quite accurately) points out that event-driven applications will remain loosly coupled, and perform better than the syncronous, blocking, multi-threaded apps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With My Node.js Hat...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js developers should sign the manifesto, and be proud of the common ground they can find the with Java/Scala developers using Play!. &nbsp;The event-driven, non-blocking approach works with the Node.js theory perfectly. &nbsp;A couple specific things that sync up well
<ul>
<li>Node <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html">Streams</a>&nbsp;implement a lot of functionality for fulfilling the "responsive" part of the reactive manifesto. &nbsp;The current version of streams provides an intuitive interface, good backpressure controls, and resistance against overloads on traffic bursts. &nbsp;If you are doing IO, and not using streams, you may be missing out on a big opportunity.</li>
<li>Callbacks, Queues, Streams, &amp; EventEmitter all provide nice ways to keep your app asynchronous and message driven.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With My Rails Hat On...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This one is a little bit harder. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% sure you can write reactive apps using Rails, I just don't know that the framework encourages it as readily.</li>
<li>Unlike Play! or Node, the web server is a little more of a wild card when using Rails. Webrick, Unicorn, Thin, Puma, etc. &nbsp;To my knowledge, the only one of those that supports non-blocking IO is Thin, but even that is subject to the blocking aspect of Rails.</li>
<li>EventMachine has some nice features for writing reactive, event-based ruby apps.</li>
<li>I think I'm going to have to stop there, and work on a who separate post re: Reactive Applications in Rails.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yes, I signed. &nbsp;While the manifesto smells too much like a marketing tool for Play!/Typesafe, I can't hate on a good idea. &nbsp;Read the <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">manifesto</a>, sign it if you like what you read, and leave me some comments if you think I'm way off base on this one.</strong></p>
