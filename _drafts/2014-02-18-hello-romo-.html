<p>So, we got an adorable Romo to live at our house.  His name is Slar, after the gorn from Star Trek.  Yeah.</p>
<p>The tutorials and lab are fun, but what I'm really interested in is developing an app using the SDK.  To get started, romotive has documentation here  http://romotive.com/developers-quickstart/, but lets start out slow and see what we get.</p>
<p>Fire up Xcode</p>
<p>1.  Start from the HelloRomo project</p>
<p>Delete the romo folder and then drag the 2 frameworks &amp; 1 bundle into the frameworks in xcode</p>
<p>If you're only using RMCore:<br />
Drag frameworks/RMCore.framework into your app's frameworks folder.<br />
In additon, go to the "Build Phases" tab for your app's target, and add the following external frameworks:<br />
 CoreMotion.framework<br />
 ExternalAccessory.framework<br />
If you're only using RMCharacter:<br />
Drag frameworks/RMCharacter.framework and frameworks/RMCharacter.bundle into your app's frameworks folder.<br />
In additon, go to the "Build Phases" tab for your app's target, and add the following external frameworks:<br />
 AVFoundation.framework<br />
 QuartzCore.framework</p>
