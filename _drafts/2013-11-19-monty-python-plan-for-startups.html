<p>Logo and tagline are less important than you think.  Monty Python used a foot.  Additional funding can fix a logo.  It can't fix a bad or improperly executed vision</p>
<p>Love Open Source - Monty Python used a public domain song.  Could they have spent money on a custom song?  Possibly.  However, it probably wouldn't have been a better song than Sousa could write, and it would have taken focus away from their product - Comedy.  Don't let concerns about support and "enterprise-readiness" distract you.  When you have a killer product, someone will always be willing to sell you support.</p>
